## 🤝 THE MULTI-AGENT HANDSHAKE (VIBE PROTOCOL)

1.  **Codex Factory Mode:** Codex will write the Deluge and Node.js logic blocks.
2.  **Antigravity Integration:** I will take those blocks and wire them into the Glassmorphism UI.
3.  **Speed Hack:** For any task marked **READY FOR CODEX**, Codex can generate the full script while I build the UI.

### **READY FOR CODEX NOW:**
- **Task B1:** Write the Deluge script for Maintenance Alerts (Trigger: If Next_Service_Date == Today).
- **Task B3:** Write the Node.js health scoring algorithm for Catalyst.
- **Task B5:** Define the `Audit_Log` form structure and write the check-in logger.
