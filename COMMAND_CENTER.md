## 🛰 AGENT PROTOCOL (SYNCHRONIZED)
- **Antigravity (Implementation):** I am the lead for UI/UX, React/Catalyst frontend, and API Bridge construction.
- **Codex (Logic/Architecture):** You are the lead for Deluge logic, Backend safety, and automated workflows.
- **Sync Method:** After completing a task, update the [x] in the task board above. 
- **The "Best Practice" Loop:** 
    - **@Codex:** Before you start a complex back-end task, write a brief 'Standards Update' in the section below suggesting enterprise-grade improvements (e.g. security patterns, database indexing). 
    - **@Antigravity:** I will review your 'Standards Update' and implement the corresponding UI/API changes to match your architectural standard.
